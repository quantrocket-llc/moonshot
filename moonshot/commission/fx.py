from moonshot.commission.base import PercentageCommission

class SpotFXCommission(PercentageCommission):
    """
    Commission class for spot FX. This class can be used as-is.

    Notes
    -----
    Min commissions are not modeled for spot FX. This is because min
    commissions for spot FX are in USD ($2), regardless of the quote
    currency. The Moonshot class passes NLVs in the quote currency (the
    Currency field). To accurately model min commissions, these NLVs would need
    to be converted to USD.
