class FixedSlippage(Slippage):
    """
    Apply a fixed pct slippage to each trade.

    This slippage class can be used on strategies indirectly (and more
    easily) by simply specifying SLIPPAGE_BPS on the strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ONE_WAY_SLIPPAGE : float
        the slippage to apply to each trade (default 0.0005 = 5 basis points);
        overridden if `one_way_slippage` is passed to __init__
